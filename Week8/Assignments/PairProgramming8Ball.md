## Details

Create a magic 8-ball webpage, powered by JavaScript.

The page should consist of a place where a phrase will appear, and a **shake** button that will cause a phrase to appear.

### Stretch Tasks

The required tasks of this assignment will lead to a very bare-bones 8-ball. You can use CSS and more JavaScript and jQuery to make this pretty cool, though.

## Hints

Play around in the console to investigate the properties of elements that are modifiable.
