The following is a list of requirements for the final project
- Site is deployed and live
- Site is responsive to mobile
- Site is functional - every public facing feature has to be accessible through a link and working
- Site is robust/resistant to user breakage
  - Example: leaving form fields blank shouldn't result in a server error
- Site must properly cite all students and any other resources used as specified in their licenses
  - Include links to team portfolios/resumes
- Site addresses the need initially identified in the pitch
  - Team completed the vision of the product owner
- Site is user-friendly - user experience is a priority
- Site has good design/aesthetics
  - Doesn't look like "default bootstrap"
  - Professional, thematically styled
- Site has professional quality code

The final project should be an MVC project/web application that is unique, addresses a need that is not currently being addressed, and is 
achievable within the 3 week time span. The project will be divided into sprints - an initial stretch of time to build the basics of the 
project, a second stretch of time to strengthen the functionality and features of the project, a third stretch of time to work on front-end
design and finalize any features included in the project, and a final, fourth stretch of time that will be dedicated purely to polishing
and debugging the project. The dates for the sprints are as follows:
- Sprint 1
  - Begins on Monday March 6th and ends on Friday March 10th
- Sprint 2
  - Begins on Friday March 10th and ends on Tuesday March 14th
- Sprint 3
  - Begins on Tuesday March 14th and ends on Friday March 17th
- Sprint 4
  - Begins on Friday March 17th and ends on Wednesday March 22nd
  
Each sprint will be graded at 50 points per sprint, and the final project will be graded at 100 points, making the final project overall
worth 300 points. Additional information on how each sprint will be graded will be provided in the near future.

The meeting with each group on Monday March 6th will be strictly a Sprint-Planning Meeting. Meetings on March 10th, 14th and 17th will 
start with a Sprint Retrospective from the previous sprint, and then also involve Sprint-Planning for the upcoming sprint. The meetings on
March 22nd will be purely sprint review, retrospective, and conclusion.

We will be having daily stand-up meetings with each group. These will each last approximately 5 minutes, and will involve each member of the
group reporting three things:
- What have you done for the project since the last stand-up?
- What's up next for you on this project?
- Are there any blockers getting in the way of your progress on this project?

If there are blockers, we will try to quickly address them during stand-up or make a plan to address them. These meetings are called 
stand-ups because they should be so brief that the members of the group do not get tired from standing during the meeting. It is perfectly
acceptable to say "ditto" as your entire report during stand-up.

Further information will be provided regarding the final project as we move forward. Hopefully this is a good starting point!
