# MVC Review Site Project

## Overview

For this project you will be developing an MVC application that uses multiple models and foreign keys to model a relationship. You have the choice to develop either a Technology Review site or a Travel Review site.

You should have at least two models and a foreign key relationship. You should be able to view the styled home page, click a review and view a styled detail page.


After your app is created populate the Categories table with at least 3 categories, and your Reviews table with at least 5 mock reviews. Feel free to fill them out Lorem Ipsum.
